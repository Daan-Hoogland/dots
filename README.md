# dots
Repository containing the dotfiles I use to configure multiple applications, such as i3wm and polybar.

Fonts used are [Cherry](https://github.com/turquoise-hexagon/cherry) and [Siji](https://github.com/stark/siji).

The `init.sh` file is used to intialize symbolic links to all the configuration paths. For now, it's just a simple script that creates symlinks. I hope to make it more configurable and error resistant when I have the time.

- [x] Add script to create symlinks.
- [ ] Make script check for existing files.
- [ ] Make script more configurable (selecting applications, custom colors etc).
